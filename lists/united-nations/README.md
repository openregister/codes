# United Nations

The UN publishes [national
classifications](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdnld.asp?Lg=1)
(ISIC), which the Office for National Statistics then republishes with a UK
flavour.

The potential use to us is if the UN edition is available in a more convenient
form than PDF.  Most editions seem to be available as Microsoft Access
databases, which is a good start, so if they're compatible with ONS's PDFs then
that will make the impossible possible.
