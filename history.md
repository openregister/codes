# The history page of the original alpha register

####August 2017
The industrial classification register remains open for feedback.

Due to restrictions on publishing in the run-up to the General Election in June 2017 we did not publish a blog post at the time the register moved into alpha. We have been notified by the current custodian on 16th August that there will be change of circumstances meaning that WEF 7th September there will be a new custodian in place - name TBC. As we have a blog post almost ready to publish the current custodian would rather delay publishing until September when the new custodian will be confirmed and their details can be updated to the post.

####May 2017
The industrial classification register moved into alpha on 11th May and is now open for feedback.

####April 2017
The industrial classification register will be hosted on the Open Register platform and so conforms to the technical standards.

For the alpha register, any updates that are required to the data will be made by the GDS registers team following agreement with the register's custodian. When the register moves into beta the GDS registers team will support the custodian to update their register including providing tools to make it easy for the custodian to manage register updates.

####April 2017
There will be a link to provide feedback at the top of each page of the alpha industrial classification register. All feedback will be sent to the registers team at GDS. Both the registers team and the custodian will respond to feedback, depending on whether it relates to the registers product or the data.

####April 2017

While producing this register we looked at several major government services that use lists of Standard Industrial Classification codes to understand their needs. We will invite these services to share their feedback on the register when it moves into the alpha phase.

####April 2017

It was agreed that the following fields would feature in the register:

* **Industrial-classification:** The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code.
* **Parent-industrial-classification:** The parent entries standard industrial classification.
* **Name:** The commonly-used name of a record.
* **Start-date:** The date a record first became relevant to a register.
* **End-date:** The date a record stopped being applicable.

The custodian has confirmed that punctuation in the data in both the Industrial-classification and Parent-industrial-classification fields must remain in the register because European regulation requires UK Standard Industrial Classification codes to remain identical to those published by the European Unionâ€™s NACE system.

####February 2017
